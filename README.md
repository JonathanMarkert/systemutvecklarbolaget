## About the project
We made a storepage for selling nerdbrew bear for programmers (and for others with good taste).
The name of the page and logo is based of a swedish alcohol distributer, SystemBolaget, but the design and layout is out own.

For this project we have used Material UI and React to deliver an application with shoppincart
features, a simple checkout form + validations, an admin page and components for localstorage.
The page is fully responsive, meaning that we have considered any device, such as tablets, smartphones and widescreen monitors. We used React Router to navigate between different pages.

We have used Typescript as our main programming language and mocked our components and data using Typescript Interfeces and CSS for styling our layout and components on the page. (Links down below).
